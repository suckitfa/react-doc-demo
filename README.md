# what is it ?
some code in React Doc. That's it, no big deal.

# how to run it ?
simple.. only three line of commands.....
```sh
cd react-doc-demo # into the dirctory
yarn install # install all the dependency
yarn start # start the project
```

that's all...........

Here is some note that I think is important: 

Take a look  at  `React文档内容.md`
